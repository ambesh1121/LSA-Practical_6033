
Aim: SSH server

Theory:

Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.

Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH.

SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using a clientâ€“server architecture, 
connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server.
The protocol specification distinguishes between two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. 
The standard TCP port for SSH is 22. 
SSH is generally used to access Unix-like operating systems, but it can also be used on Microsoft Windows. 
Windows 10 uses OpenSSH as its default SSH client and SSH server.





Steps and Commands:

1) Command to install ssh server:
   ambesh@kali:~$ sudo dpkf -l openssh-server		(OR)

   ambesh@kali:~$ sudo apt-get -y install openssh-server

2) Command to enable a service:  
   ambesh@kali:~$ sudo systemctl enable ssh

3) Command to status a service:  
   ambesh@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status ssh

4) Now To configure user's server to allow incoming SSH connections, user can use this command: 
   ambesh@kali:~$ sudo ufw allow ssh

5) After this user can connect to the ssh localhost by the command:
   ambesh@kali:~$ ssh localhost

  User can enter the root password to connect to the localhost
