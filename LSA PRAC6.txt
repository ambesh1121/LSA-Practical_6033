Aim: NFS


Theory:

NFS(Network File System) is basically developed for sharing of files and folders between Linux/Unix systems by Sun Microsystems in 1980. 
It allows you to mount your local file systems over a network and remote hosts to interact with them as they are mounted locally on the same system.
A Network File System (NFS) allows remote hosts to mount file systems over a network and interact with those file systems as though they are mounted locally. 
This enables system administrators to consolidate resources onto centralized servers on the network.
Currently, there are three versions of NFS. NFS version 2 (NFSv2) is older and widely supported. 
NFS version 3 (NFSv3) supports safe asynchronous writes and is more robust at error handling than NFSv2;it also supports 64-bit file sizes and offsets


Commands:

sudo apt-get -y install kernel-server
sudo apt-get -y install nfs-kernel-server
sudo systemct1 enable nfs-kernel-server

mkdir demo_dir
vi a.txt
ls a.txt
mv a.txt demo_dir
ls/home/ambesh/demo_dir

sudo vi /etc/exports
cat /etc/exports

write this in /etc/exports
/home/ambesh/demo_dir 127.0.0.1(rw) 

sudo exportfs -ra

sudo apt-get  -y install nfs-common
sudo mkdir /home/ambesh_directory

sudo mount -t nfs 127.0.01:/home/ambesh/demo_dir /home/ambesh_directory

cd /home/ambesh_directory
ls
