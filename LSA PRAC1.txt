Aim: Installation of DHCP Server in Ubuntu 16.04

Theory:
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP) is a network management protocol used to automate the process
of configuring devices on IP networks.
A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each
device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.
DHCP is a client-server protocol in which servers manage a pool of unique IP addresses, as well as
information about client configuration parameters, and assign addresses out of those address pools.	

Every device on a TCP/IP-based network must have a unique unicast IP address to access the network
and its resources. Without DHCP, IP addresses for new computers or computers that are moved from 
one subnet to another must be configured manually; IP addresses for computers that are removed from 
the network must be manually reclaimed.

DHCP-enabled clients send a request to the DHCP server whenever they connect to a network.

ADVANTAGES of DHCP:-
(1)Centralized management of IP addresses.
(2)The implementation does not require any additional costs.
(3)Ease of adding new clients to a network.


DISADVANTAGES of DHCP:-
(1)DHCP server can be single point of failure in networks having only one configured DHCP server.
(2)The machine name does not change when new IP address is assigned.


Steps to install the DHCP Server
(1)Command to install dhcp-server:  
   kali@ambesh:~$sudo apt install -y isc-dhcp-server
(2)Then configure your dhcpd.conf by directly editing through a path : 
   kali@ambesh:~$sudo nano/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
(3)You can get to know about your ip address by: 
   $kali@ambesh:~$ip addr
(4)We then configure the subnet and the netmask(dhcpd.conf),then just save the file and exit
(5)Then to enable the services use the command:
   kali@ambesh:~$sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server.service
(6)Then start the service : 
   kali@ambesh:~$sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server.service
