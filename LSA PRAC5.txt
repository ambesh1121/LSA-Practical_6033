                                                               Practical No: 5

Aim:Samba server.


Theory:
 
Samba is a open source software.
Samba uses TCP/IP protocol.
Samba is Linux implementation of SMB/CIFS protocols.
Samba allows interoperability between Linux and Window.
Samba provide file and print sharing service between Linux and Window system.
Samba allows Linux to interact with Window client, Server, member of Active Directory, Primary domain controller, or member server.
Samba support Microsoft Access Control Lists.
Main configuration file of Samba server is /etc/samba/smb.conf
 
Commands:

1)smbd
sudo apt-get -y install samba
sudo systemctl start smbd
sudo systemctl status smbd

2)nmbd
sudo systemctl start nmbd
sudo systemctl status nmbd

3)make a samba_shared directory in /home/ambesh 

4)make few txt files in /home/ambesh/samba_shared 
touch a.txt b.txt c.txt

5)
cd /etc/samba
ls /etc/samba

6)backup of smb.conf 
cp smb.conf smb.conf_bkp 

7)few configuration in /etc/smb.conf
sudo nano smb.conf

8)delete all the things inside smb.conf and write:

  [samba_shared]
	comment = Welcome to samba
	path = /home/ambesh/samba_shared
	browseable = yes
	read only = yes
	guest ok = no

9)download smbclient 
sudo apt-get -y install smbclient

10)start services
sudo systemctl start smbd
sudo systemctl stop nmbd

Also,check both smbd and nmbd statuses too

11)whoami

12)sudo pdbedit -a -u $(whoami)

13)sudo pdbedit -L (to check all users)

14)make any connectionn possible to connect:
    $ sudo ufw allow from (your ip addr) any app Samba

15)To check ip  
ip a 		(OR) 
ip addr

16)reload your firewall 
 sudo ufw reload  

17)whether it's working
sudo smbcllient -U <username> -L  //your ip

18)smbd and nmbd services:
 sudo systemctl restart smbd
 sudo systemctl restart nmbd

19)heck their status 


Windows OS Part:

1)In windows OS and press windows + R, ip address, 

2)Now again one more pop up box will open, write the credentials 

3)Now you can see samba_shared and documents folder.

4)In samba_shared server you can see all the txt files

5)Successfully shared and connected.
